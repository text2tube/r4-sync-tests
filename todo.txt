future features

- run sync() on first load automatically for better ux
- mass tracks edit batch editor interface. like a giant table where you can edit all fields. save all button. or maybe it just saves onblur ala a spreadsheet? put this /{slug}/mass-edit. mass undo
- find a way to share `track_meta` data between users. push it remote, how? security?
