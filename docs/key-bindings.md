# Key bindings

Like every other app this one supports keyboard shortcuts, or bindings.

In this app however we expose certain functions from $lib/api.js.

On /settings you can customize which key bindings you want to use for which actions. Your config is stored into the local database.

```
{
	"j": "toggleQueuePanel",
	"$mod+k": "openSearch",
}
```
