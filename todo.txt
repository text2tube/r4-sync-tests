IDEAS

- refactor <Player /> with more sub-components?
- redo player by optimize player and header layout for mobile first!!!
- after adding a track the modal form resets, which is fine, but there's no clear ux to indicate that it was saved correctly. One idea is to add the <TrackCard> below. The r4-track-form thing must 
- mass tracks edit batch editor interface. like a giant table where you can edit all fields. save all button. or maybe it just saves onblur ala a spreadsheet? put this /{slug}/mass-edit. mass undo

HARD ONES

- find a way to share `track_meta` data between users. push it remote, how? security?

DONE

- run sync() on first load automatically for better ux
