# Broadcast Feature

Starting a broadcast updates your local `app_state.broadcasting_channel_id` and syncs to the remote Supabase `broadcast` table. When you join a broadcast, the app fetches the remote broadcast data, ensures the track exists locally (pulling the entire channel if needed), then syncs your player to that track. The `live-broadcasts.svelte` component subscribes to Supabase real-time for broadcast changes and shows active broadcasts in the header.

Broadcasts are stored remotely only - there's no local `broadcasts` table, just `app_state` fields for your own broadcast and listening status. When you change tracks while broadcasting, the remote broadcast row updates automatically. Joining a broadcast requires the track to be available locally, so the app will pull the entire channel if needed. Broadcasts older than 10 minutes are rejected when joining. Each channel can only have one active broadcast at a time since `channel_id` is the primary key in the remote table.

## Files

The core broadcast logic and remote sync lives in `src/lib/broadcast.js`. The UI for starting and stopping broadcasts is in `src/routes/broadcast/+page.svelte`. The header component that shows live broadcasts is `src/lib/components/live-broadcasts.svelte`. Track availability and sync functions are in `src/lib/api.js`.

## Confusing Parts

Your broadcast status lives in local `app_state`, but active broadcasts from others are fetched directly from Supabase - this creates a hybrid local/remote state pattern. Unlike other app data, broadcasts aren't synced to the local database because they're ephemeral presence data, not persistent content. Joining a broadcast may trigger a full channel sync if the track doesn't exist locally, which can be surprising. When a broadcast is stopped, any clients listening to it automatically have their listening state cleared through the real-time subscription.
