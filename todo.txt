IDEAS

- after adding a track the modal form resets, which is fine, but there's no clear ux to indicate that it was saved correctly. One idea is to add the <TrackCard> below.
- optimize player and header layout for mobile first!!!
- mass tracks edit batch editor interface. like a giant table where you can edit all fields. save all button. or maybe it just saves onblur ala a spreadsheet? put this /{slug}/mass-edit. mass undo
- batch pull of sync/musicbrainz (ala sync/youtube)
- find a way to share `track_meta` data between users. push it remote, how? security?

DONE

- run sync() on first load automatically for better ux
