IDEAS

- how to deal with volume on mobile
- after adding a track the modal form resets, which is fine, but there's no clear ux to indicate that it was saved correctly. One idea is to add the <TrackCard> below. The r4-track-form thing must
- mass tracks edit batch editor interface â†’ comprehensive design in @batch-editing.md
- themable ui, introduce semantic css variables
- the <youtube-player> fires volumechange seemingly at will, many times on load, which currently overwrites any appState.volume the user might already have. In other words, your volume preferences is persisted, but also overwritten on load
- set pwa theme color based on color scheme? https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/975 https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6569

HARD ONES

- find a way to share `track_meta` data between users. push it remote, how? security?

DONE

- run sync() on first load automatically for better ux
- redo player by optimize player and header layout for mobile first!!!
- refactor <Player /> with more sub-components?
- refactor layout.svelte to more components
